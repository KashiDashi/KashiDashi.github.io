      <img src="images/final.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" class="w3-hover-opacity" alt="Finally near the end of the class. I'm glad I ended up taking this class as I have always been fascinated with medieval texts (courtesy of growing up watching a lot of BBC shows like Merlin and Horrible Histories) and originally wanted to pursue an English degree. When I first started this class, I wasn't quite sure what types of texts we were going to read, but I liked the selection of different texts and it really showed me the variety of stories that people back then could write. From romantic stories in the lai romance genre like Lanval to stories of adventure like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. There were ones that were unexpectedly funny too like The Miller's Tale and The Second Shepard's Play. 
      So if I were to say what this class was about and what I learnt, I would say it would be about discovering that there is variety when it comes to stories and how people lived in time periods that you wouldnât think of and to not make assumptions (never would I think that there would be such a unique as a person as Margery Kempe that could exist in such times). In addition, I also saw how everythng we read is connected, from conventions of the lai genre (such as the Once Upon a Time opening, takes place in Spring, adventurous, black and white morality) to how works influenced each other as well like how both Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe knew each other and both had visions. I learnt a lot of middle english and some latin words (such as osculare fundamentum = kiss my ass which I shall be saving for use at a later date) as well as realising that I find Latin as a language to be really interesting to learn. I started learning it on Duolingo because I was fascinated at how many words are derived from Latin (and I guess it would also be cool to say that I know Latin).
